# Checklists for earthen wall construction inspection
  - In the spirit of [reconciliation](https://nrw.reconciliation.org.au/actions-for-reconciliation/) Earthsteading acknowledges the significant contribution of Indigenous culturals worldwide who have pioneered the use and adoption of earthen materials in building construction.  We pay our respect to the traditional custodians of country throughout Australia; to their elders past and present and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Indigenous peoples who pioneered earthen buildings worldwide.  Please see references at the bottom of this page for contributions to this tradition.
  - This repository was created as part of Federation University Building Surveyor Advanced Diploma earthen build Performance Solution project (2020).

# Performance-solutions for earthen construction
Civil and structural engineering solutions for earthen loadbearing _unfired_ walls, including:
  - [x] [Rammed earth aka pis√© de terre (formwork & tyre casing)](https://github.com/earthsteading/performance-solutions/blob/main/earthen-walls.md#rammed-earth-formwork--tyre-encased)
  - [x] [Adobe brick and cob walls (low-density & high-density earth)](https://github.com/earthsteading/performance-solutions/blob/main/earthen-walls.md#adobe-bricks-and-cob-walls)
  - [ ] SuperAdobe(TM) cement stabilised
  - [ ] [Straw-bale earthen rendered walls](https://github.com/earthsteading/performance-solutions/blob/main/straw-bale-wall-structures.md)
  - [ ] Hemp-crete blocks and walls
  - [ ] Poured and light earth methods
  - [x] [Earthen surface coatings, e.g. straw light clay, slaked/hdyrated lime, lime puttty grout, tadelakt, etc](https://github.com/earthsteading/performance-solutions/blob/main/earthen-walls.md#external-earthen-surface-coatings)
  - [x] [Bushfire building protection, e.g. remote controlled wall wetting sprinklers, bushfire shutters](https://github.com/earthsteading/performance-solutions/blob/main/bushfire.md)
  - [ ] [Lightweight timber structures aka geodesic domes](https://youtu.be/7mt8fxMfGA4)

### In-Scope construction methods: 
 - [x] currently, the standards for utilising the above materials have only been tested with one-storey buildings.
 - [x] natural subsoil comprised of clay, varying percentages of silt, sand, gravel and aggregate able to be air-dryed to a density of 800-2200kg/m3.
 - [x] earthen admixtures / stabalisers (straw, cullulose, wood shavings, polypropolene, portland cement) are permissable and can help decrease shrinkage.
 - [x] Mass produced earthen construction componets, abiding by manufacturing quality control, e.g. tests every 1500 units, etc.

### Out-of-scope construction methods:
 - [ ] earthen mixtures stabalised by cement or lime and pressed into bricks are required to be "bond wynch tested" for rigidity.
 - [ ] earthen structures made of organic matter, a high percentage of water-soluable salts (like beach sand), earthen renders which flake from moisture creep and/or any earthen material which fails the wet/dry appraisal test
 - [ ] earthen materials larger than gravel (+20mm diameter), other than screened/caged road surface rocks.
 - [ ] any builder who does not utilise the required on-site tests (and maintain a 'quality control' record) for production of earthen componets.
