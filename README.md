# Checklists for earthen wall construction inspection
  - In the spirit of [reconciliation](https://nrw.reconciliation.org.au/actions-for-reconciliation/) Earthsteading acknowledges the significant contribution of Indigenous culturals worldwide who have pioneered the use and adoption of earthen materials in building construction.  We pay our respect to the traditional custodians of country throughout Australia; to their elders past and present and extend that respect to all Aborriginal and indigenous peoples worldwide.  Please see references at the bottom of this page for contributions to this tradition.
  - This repository was created as part of Federation University Building Surveyor Advanced Diploma earthen build project (2020).

# Performance-solutions for earthen construction
Civil and structural engineering solutions for earthen loadbearing _unfired_ walls, including:
  - [x] [Rammed earth aka pisé de terre (formwork & tyre casing)](https://github.com/earthsteading/performance-solutions/blob/main/earthen-walls.md#rammed-earth-formwork--tyre-encased)
  - [x] [Adobe brick and cob walls (low-density & high-density earth)](https://github.com/earthsteading/performance-solutions/blob/main/earthen-walls.md#adobe-bricks-and-cob-walls)
  - [ ] SuperAdobe(TM) cement stabilised
  - [ ] Straw-bale earthen rendered walls
  - [ ] Hemp-crete blocks and walls
  - [ ] Poured and light earth methods
  - [x] [Earthen surface coatings, e.g. straw light clay, slaked/hdyrated lime, lime puttty grout, tadelakt, etc](https://github.com/earthsteading/performance-solutions/blob/main/earthen-walls.md#external-earthen-surface-coatings)
  - [x] [Bushfire building protection, e.g. remote controlled wall wetting sprinklers, bushfire shutters](https://github.com/earthsteading/performance-solutions/blob/main/bushfire.md)

### In-Scope construction methods: 
 - [X] currently, the standards for utilising the above materials have only been tested with one-storey buildings.
 - [X] natural subsoil comprised of clay, varying percentages of silt, sand, gravel and aggregate able to be air-dryed to a density of 800-2200kg/m3.
 - [x] earthen admixtures / stabalisers (straw, cullulose, wood shavings, polypropolene, portland cement) are permissable and can help decrease shrinkage.
 - [x] Mass produced earthen construction componets, abiding by manufacturing quality control, e.g. tests every 1500 units, etc.

### Out-of-scope construction methods:
 - [ ] earthen mixtures stabalised by cement or lime and pressed into bricks are required to be "bond wynch tested" for rigidity.
 - [ ] earthen structures made of organic matter, a high percentage of water-soluable salts (like beach sand), earthen renders which flake from moisture creep and/or any earthen material which fails the wet/dry appraisal test
 - [ ] earthen materials larger than gravel (+20mm diameter), other than screened/caged road surface rocks.
 - [ ] any builder who does not utilise the required on-site tests (and maintain a 'quality control' record) for production of earthen componets.

### Terminology (quantitatively defined):
 - flexure tensile strength aka modulus of rupture = if all materials are homogenous then all fibers in the material are the same stress and failure will intiate when the weakest fiber reaches it's limiting tensile stress.
 - load capacity reduction factor = ratio of the bearing capacity against eccentric loading and central loading.  Divide the value of the elastic strength by the yield strength which yields the R factor.
 - erosion = erosion bore hole test and erodibility of geomaterial testing.
 - permeance / permeability = coefficient of hydrophilic material.
 - shrinkage - can take place for extended periods up to six months.

# Quality control
All production of earthen materials and compoents must have a written plan for batching, recording and evaluating their quality and consistency, especially for ratios of earth, clay and admixtures for load-bearing walls.

## Testing requirements
The following sets of tests are referenced for earthen materials.  Test samples should have between 3-5% moisture content and be dried/cured at temperatures below 69°C for a minimum of 30 days.  A minimum of 7 samples should be used in testing.
 - [ ] geotechnical test
 - [ ] compression test
 - [ ] wet/dry appraisal test
 - [ ] durability test
 - [ ] shrinkage test
 - [ ] on-site moisture handful drop test
 - [ ] whole brick drop test
 - [ ] layering test
 - [ ] density test
 - [ ] clay content test
 - [ ] lateral strain/rigidity
 - [ ] vertical strain/rigidity
 - [ ] tolerances

## Site preparation
 - [ ] foundation and footings constructed against AS2870, especially a vapour barrier to resist rising ground moisture.
 - [ ] use of reinforced steel starter bars and mesh shall be used for concrete base work, e.g. spacing +/-20-50mm pending engineer specifications.
 - [ ] performance solutions are available for polypropolene biaxial/triaxial geogrid as per BS EN ISO 10319
 - [ ] all metal reinformcent bars must be protected from corrosion (enclosed in plastic polyethylene sleeves or medium duty uPVC pipe) and have a minimum of 100mm earthen cover for external walls.
 - [ ] vertical + horizontal steel should be latticed throughout the earthen wall cell to maintain their correct position throughout the wall; horizontal steel reinforcement should not exceed 12mm diameters.
 - [ ] use of polypropylene geogrid is recomended for horizontal reinforcement and should be positioned centrally and attached with steel rods woven through geo-grid which must bear against above vertical layer with a minimum cover of 40mm in any location.
 - [ ] services conduits should not be in contact with the reiforcment steel bars or their conduits.
 - [ ] any opening cut into earthen walls should be at least 25mm away from reinforcement bars and should be filled with mortar ASAP.
 - [ ] mechanical welds should be used for laps/gaps/splices and adhere to AS/NZS3500.
 - [ ] all metal work within earthen walls must be hot-dip galvanised or painted with zinc rich paint, esp in marine and industrial areas exposed to excessive salts.
 - [ ] External structural bracing should be used throughout construction and curing of earthen materials, esp load bearing walls. See AS1170 and AS3600.
 - [ ] Earth walls must be protected from weather (covered + drainage), especially from rain or pooling water.
 - [ ] Earth walls will injure and cause fatalities if they collapose on humans given their considerable weight.

## Construction sequence
  - [ ] Earthen walls require a minimum cure of 28 days prior to being structurally capable of withstanding wind/snow/earth actions.
  - [ ] Earthen bricks must be mortared and dried prior to progressing to the next vertical load layer.
  - [ ] All corners and intersecting walls must be self-bracing.
  - [ ] High gable walls are vulnerable and should be built after the roof framing is able to provide lateral bracing and/or butressing.
  - [ ] Cold weather construction >2°C should not proceed and protections should be available to avoid freezing of water within earth materials.
  - [ ] Excessive heat (rapid curing/drying) of earthen walls can cause cracking, especially if exposed to winds.  Jointing should be cleaned up progressively.
  - [ ] Height to length ratio should not exceed 1:2 for walls with openings such as wide windows.
  - [ ] Control joints shall be used in all earthen walls, including (a) at both sides of an opening, (b) at any step change in wall height, (c) at changes in wall thickness, (d) at each end of the lintel up to the bond beam top plate, (e) in walls adjacent to corners providing support for the corner without interupting the continuity of earthen layers through the corner, e.g. spaced at least 900mm away from corner. NB contol joints should transfer forces perpendicular to the wall face and allow expansion/contractino of each wall panel. Control joints should be both insect proof and sealed.
  - [ ] Surface finishes must not trap or hold water in the earthen wall.
  - [ ] Bond beams must be constructed in accordance with AS3700 and AS/NZS1170.
