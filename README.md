# Performance-solutions for earthen construction
Civil and structural engineering solutions for earthen loadbearing _unfired_ walls, including:
  - [x] Rammed earth aka pis√© de terre (frame & tyre casing)
  - [x] Adobe brick and cob walls (low-density & high-density earth)
  - [x] SuperAdobe cement stabilised
  - [x] Straw-bale earthen rendered walls
  - [x] Hemp-crete blocks and walls
  - [x] Poured and light earth methods
  - [x] Earthen surface coatings, e.g. straw light clay, slaked/hdyrated lime, lime puttty grout, tadelakt, etc

### In-Scope construction methods: 
 - [X] currently, the standards for utilising the above materials have only been tested with one-storey buildings.
 - [X] natural subsoil comprised of clay, varying percentages of silt, sand, gravel and aggregate able to be air-dryed to a density of 800-2200kg/m3.
 - [x] earthen admixtures / stabalisers (straw, cullulose, wood shavings, polypropolene, portland cement) are permissable and can help decrease shrinkage.
 - [x] Mass produced earthen construction componets, abiding by manufacturing quality control, e.g. tests every 2000 units, etc.

### Out-of-scope construction methods:
 - [ ] earthen mixtures stabalised by cement or lime and pressed into bricks are required to be "bond wynch tested" for rigidity.
 - [ ] earthen structures made of organic matter, a high percentage of water-soluable salts (like beach sand), earthen renders which flake from moisture creep and/or any earthen material which fails the wet/dry appraisal test
 - [ ] earthen materials larger than gravel (+20mm diameter), other than screened/caged road surface rocks.
 - [ ] any builder who does not utilise the required on-site tests (and maintain a 'quality control' record) for production of earthen componets.

### Terminology (mathematically defined):
 - flexure tensile strength aka modulus of rupture = average of 10-50% of compressive strength, e.g. stabalised adobe should have 30% or 3.5x flexural tensile strength.  Laboratory tests should be utilsed if on-site testing is inconslusive.
 - durable
 - erosion 
 - permeance
 - shrinkage - can take place for extended periods up to six months.

## Adobe bricks and cob walls
 - [ ] Air dried above 5 degrees celsius for a minimum of 28 days in an exterior environment protected from strong wind and rain.
 - [ ] A curing process must be undertaken to assure water evaporation is limited for cracking during shrinkage.
 - [ ] Water pipes must be encased within conduit if going through an adobe wall.
 - [ ] Loadbearing walls should be finished smooth, not raked.

## Earthen mortar joints
 - [ ] Sand + lime + portland cement = 9:2:1 to 9:3:0 ratio; mechanically mixed, slump tested and laid in 10-20mm thick beds.
 - [ ] Sand and clay earthen mortars must be trial tested and quality controlled during production, pressing/ramming and laid in 15-35mm thick beds.
