In the sprit of reconciliation Earthsteading acknowledges the significant contribution of Indigenous culturals worldwide who  have pioneered the use and adoption of earthen materials in building construction.  We pay our respect to the traditional custodians of country throughout Australia; to their elders past and present and extend that respect to all Aborriginal and indigenous peoples worldwide.  Please see references at the bottom of this page for contributions to this tradition.

# Performance-solutions for earthen construction
Civil and structural engineering solutions for earthen loadbearing _unfired_ walls, including:
  - [x] Rammed earth aka pisé de terre (formwork & tyre casing)
  - [x] Adobe brick and cob walls (low-density & high-density earth)
  - [x] SuperAdobe cement stabilised
  - [x] Straw-bale earthen rendered walls
  - [x] Hemp-crete blocks and walls
  - [x] Poured and light earth methods
  - [x] Earthen surface coatings, e.g. straw light clay, slaked/hdyrated lime, lime puttty grout, tadelakt, etc

### In-Scope construction methods: 
 - [X] currently, the standards for utilising the above materials have only been tested with one-storey buildings.
 - [X] natural subsoil comprised of clay, varying percentages of silt, sand, gravel and aggregate able to be air-dryed to a density of 800-2200kg/m3.
 - [x] earthen admixtures / stabalisers (straw, cullulose, wood shavings, polypropolene, portland cement) are permissable and can help decrease shrinkage.
 - [x] Mass produced earthen construction componets, abiding by manufacturing quality control, e.g. tests every 2000 units, etc.

### Out-of-scope construction methods:
 - [ ] earthen mixtures stabalised by cement or lime and pressed into bricks are required to be "bond wynch tested" for rigidity.
 - [ ] earthen structures made of organic matter, a high percentage of water-soluable salts (like beach sand), earthen renders which flake from moisture creep and/or any earthen material which fails the wet/dry appraisal test
 - [ ] earthen materials larger than gravel (+20mm diameter), other than screened/caged road surface rocks.
 - [ ] any builder who does not utilise the required on-site tests (and maintain a 'quality control' record) for production of earthen componets.

### Terminology (mathematically defined):
 - flexure tensile strength aka modulus of rupture = average of 10-50% of compressive strength, e.g. stabalised adobe should have 30% or 3.5x flexural tensile strength.  Laboratory tests should be utilsed if on-site testing is inconslusive.
 - duration / durable = 
 - erosion =
 - permeance / permeability = 
 - shrinkage - can take place for extended periods up to six months.

# Quality control
All production of earthen materials and compoents must have a written plan for batching, recording and evaluating their quality and consistency, especially for ratios of earth, eater and admixtures for load-bearing walls.

## Testing requirements
The following sets of tests are referenced for earthen materials.  Test samples should have between 3-5% moisture content and be dried/cured at temperatures below 70°C for a minimum of 28 days.  A ,minimum of 5 samples should be used in testing.
 - [ ] geotechnical test = 
 - [ ] compression test = 1.9f(e) compression strength and a flexural tensile strength of 2.1 f(et).
 - [ ] wet/dry appraisal test =
 - [ ] durability test =
 - [ ] shrinkage test = 
 - [ ] on-site moisture handful drop test =
 - [ ] whole brick drop test =
 - [ ] layering test =
 - [ ] density test =
 - [ ] clay content test = 
 - [ ] lateral strain/rigidity = resistence to wind/earth action forces resisting 20-28kN/m at 5% strain.
 - [ ] vertical strain/rigidity = 
 - [ ] tolerances = all materials and build measurements must be within +/-10mm

## Site preparation
 - [ ] foundation and footings constructed against AS2870, especially a vapour barrier to resist rising ground moisture.
 - [ ] use of reinforced steel starter bars and mesh shall be used for concrete base work, e.g. spacing +/-20-50mm pending engineer specifications.
 - [ ] performance solutions are available for polypropolene biaxial/triaxial geogrid as per BS EN ISO 10319
 - [ ] all metal reinformcent bars must be protected from corrosion (enclosed in plastic polyethylene sleeves or medium duty uPVC pipe) and have a minimum of 100mm earthen cover for external walls.
 - [ ] vertical + horizontal steel should be latticed throughout the earthen wall cell to maintain their correct position throughout the wall; horizontal steel reinforcement should not exceed 12mm diameters.
 - [ ] use of polypropylene geogrid is recomended for horizontal reinforcement and should be positioned centrally and attached with steel rods woven through geo-grid which must bear against above vertical layer with a minimum cover of 40mm in any location.
 - [ ] services conduits should not be in contact with the reiforcment steel bars or their conduits.
 - [ ] any opening cut into earthen walls should be at least 25mm away from reinforcement bars and should be filled with mortar ASAP.
 - [ ] mechanical welds should be used for laps/gaps/splices and adhere to AS/NZS3500.
 - [ ] all metal work within earthen walls must be hot-dip galvanised or painted with zinc rich paint, esp in marine and industrial areas exposed to excessive salts.
 - [ ] External structural bracing should be used throughout construction and curing of earthen materials, esp load bearing walls. See AS1170 and AS3600.
 - [ ] Earth walls must be protected from weather (covered + drainage), especially from rain or pooling water.
 - [ ] Earth walls will injure and cause fatalities if they collapose on humans given their considerable weight.

## Construction sequence
  - [ ] Earthen walls require a minimum cure of 28 days prior to being structurally capable of withstanding wind/snow/earth actions.
  - [ ] Earthen bricks must be mortared and dried prior to progressing to the next vertical load layer.
  - [ ] All corners and intersecting walls must be self-bracing.
  - [ ] High gable walls are vulnerable and should be built after the roof framing is able to provide lateral bracing and/or butressing.
  - [ ] Cold weather construction >2°C should not proceed and protections should be available to avoid freezing of water within earth materials.
  - [ ] Excessive heat (rapid curing/drying) of earthen walls can cause cracking, especially if exposed to winds.  Jointing should be cleaned up progressively.
  - [ ] Height to length ratio should not exceed 1:2 for walls with openings such as wide windows.
  - [ ] Control joints shall be used in all earthen walls, including (a) at both sides of an opening, (b) at any step change in wall height, (c) at changes in wall thickness, (d) at each end of the lintel up to the bond beam top plate, (e) in walls adjacent to corners providing support for the corner without interupting the continuity of earthen layers through the corner, e.g. spaced at least 900mm away from corner. NB contol joints should transfer forces perpendicular to the wall face and allow expansion/contractino of each wall panel. Control joints should be both insect proof and sealed.
  - [ ] Surface finishes must not trap or hold water in the earthen wall.
  - [ ] Bond beams must be constructed in accordance with AS3700 and AS/NZS1170.

# Earthen material standards
For each of the below earthen construction componets, a performance solution should be agreed between your builder, architect, engineer and building surveyor prior to applying for a build permit.

## Rammed earth (formwork + tyre encased)
In scope: formwork walls, brick and tyre encased, both for load-bearing and non-loadbearing internal and external walls.
 - [ ] If using internally reinforced steel, then use of conduits (vs plastic) is recommeneed to avoid cracking during shrinkage and enables the vertical rod to be post-tensioned.
 - [ ] Rammed earth can be used without stabalisation however use of portland cement to provide structural durability is recommended for walls built using formwork vs earthen bricks.  Rammed earth walls should be tested on site prior to approval.
 - [ ] Moisutre content for rammed earth mix must be within a 3% band of the optimum moisture content, see testing methods above.
 - [ ] Acceptable compaction tests can be determined by a 6.5kg hammer being dropped 300mm onto a rammed earth layer of 100-150mm thickness and the resulting "rings" resisting indentation.
 - [ ] For rammed earthed pressed bricks, cement is often used as a stabaliser.  Compression of bricks should be via a hydraulic power compression ram or manual long lever arm to activate a rammed compression chamber.
 - [ ] Clay and other earthen materials used from on-site should be geotechnically tested.
 - [ ] Mechanical ramming is recommended, however manual hand ramming is acceptable especially in hard to reach areas.
 - [ ] Cold joints should be rougheded to an amplitude of 5mm including clearing the old surface with water to restablish a new bond.  NB checmical keying compounds have also been used.
 - [ ] For cement stabalised rammed earth, all of the mixed batch shall be placed within 45 minutes of cement first coming in contact with the water or damp earth.
 - [ ] Holes in bricks to facilitate installation of service conduits should be drilled on site to meet in situ measurement requirements, ideally while the brick is "green" vs a cured dry brick. 
 - [ ] All holes (once conduit is installed) must be wetted and filled wiith mortar.
 - [ ] Bricks should be laid in accordance with AS3700.  In particular compression planes should be perpendicular to the face of the wall.
 - [ ] For bricks which intersect a wall in a "T" pattern, the abutting wall's bricks should extend 100mm into the load-bearing wall.
 - [ ] For bricks reinforcing steel grid or geogrid should be used in every third course with a maximum vertical spacing of 450mm for bond strength.
 - [ ] Cracks over 3mm in width which appear on both side of a panel are not acceptable.  See 'control joint' guidance above.
 - [ ] Surface finishes of earthen rammed walls should be considered by architect and engineer as part of the deisgn schematic, including: rough, smooth, pebble, flat, colour, etc.

## Adobe bricks and cob walls
In scope: freestanding load-bearing walls, non-loadbearing infill materials, furniture, etc.
 - [ ] Earth and straw for cob mixing (mechanical or rotary hoe) should be left for a 12 hour soak after initial mix, and remixed prior to placing. 
 - [ ] Brick size should be a minimum of 280mm nominal thckness for thermal and structural performance.  Brick size may and should vary to enable bonding around corners, curves and overlapping bond walls.
 - [ ] Sand or straw may be added to control drying thereby allowing the interior of the brick to dry at the same rate as the exterior which will help prevent cracking.  Straw and cellulose natural fibres should be cut to 1/2 the size of the brick/wall and added to the mix evenly.  Portland cement as an additive is also often used.
 - [ ] Adobe bricks should be molded either via a mold which is removed immediatley and air cured; or waiting until the mixture dries and brick shrinks sufficiently to remove mold.  Air drying is preferred over sun baking which will result in additional cracking.
 - [ ] Air dried above 5 degrees celsius for a minimum of 28 days in an exterior environment protected from strong wind and rain.
 - [ ] A curing process must be undertaken to assure water evaporation is limited for cracking during shrinkage.
 - [ ] After curing bricks should be laid on their side, scraped and tapped producing a 'clear ring'.
 - [ ] Cores for vertical reinforcement or service conduit may be drilled or moulded.  Holes shall be centerd in the brick and less than 1/3 the size of the brick.
 - [ ] There should be no more than 4 layers of brick laid per day to assure mortar thickness (>60mm) can stabalise per day.
 - [ ] Bricks should be laid in an overlapping bond pattern with a minimum overlap of 25%.  English, flemish, garden and stetcher bond patterns are allowed as per AS3700.
 - [ ] All brick surfaces shall be moistened before laying to reduce mortar shrinkage.
 - [ ] Good practice in slump and bellying tests should be utilised to assure mortar can fill the gaps between variation in brick sizes.  Mortar joints should be flush and no deeper than 5mm.  See above for control joint guidance.
 - [ ] For cob walls, deep keying between courses (40-50mm deep w/ 100mm centres) is required to assure bonding between layers.  Courses of 200-300mm can be laid as soon as cob is dry enough to support the weight of the next layer.  Reinforcement both vertical and horizontal should be inlaid as wall is built up.
 - [ ] Fittings, frames and vertical reinforcements shall be embedded into the wall.  Footings with vertical rebar should be allowed to settle.  Posts with fixing ties must be allowed to harden first.
 - [ ] Water pipes must be encased within conduit if going through an adobe wall.
 - [ ] Loadbearing walls should be finished smooth, not raked.
 - [ ] Control joints are recommended to assure cracking will not cause failure in earthen walls which are not cement/lime stabalised.
 - [ ] Low density adobe and cob (800-1400kg/m3 are to be coated with hydrated lime plaster.

### Earthen mortar joints
 - [ ] Sand + lime + portland cement = 9:2:1 to 9:3:0 ratio; mechanically mixed, slump tested and laid in 10-20mm thick beds.
 - [ ] Sand and clay earthen mortars must be trial tested and quality controlled during production, pressing/ramming and laid in 15-35mm thick beds.
 - [ ] There should be no internal voids in mortar courses.
