# Field tests for earthen construction
All earthen construction requires both (alpha) in-situ field tests and externally validated (beta) lab testing to assure your structure will stand the test of time. Please make yourself aware of the [significant risks for earthen wall construction](https://github.com/earthsteading/contracting-procedures/blob/main/ohs.md) including fatalities via suffocation via collapsed earthen walls.

Terminology (strongly typed):
  - [ ] α (alpha) = first in situ field test
  - [ ] β (beta) = second iterative lab test
  - [ ] characteristic strength value / factor
  - [ ] relative cumulative frequency distribution
  - [ ] abnormal test results
  - [ ] sample test results
  - [ ] σ (sigma) = standard deviation
  - [ ] δ () = coefficient of varation 
  - [ ] ϵ (epsilon) = dimensionless factor
  - [ ] φ = load capacity reduction factor

Tests:
 - [x] compression test = 1.9f(e) compression strength and a flexural tensile strength of 2.1 f(et).
 - [x] lateral strain/rigidity = resistence to wind/earth action forces resisting 20-28kN/m at 5% strain.
 - [x] tolerances = all materials and build measurements must be within +/-10mm

## Ball test of clay content for mortar
A field test for the following types of earthn walls: unstabalised adobe, cob, light earth material and/or earth plaster
  - [ ] form earth material into a ball with a 15-20mm diameter (create +5x balls for curing tests);
  - [ ] allow the 5x sample earthen balls to dry in situ;
  - [ ] once ball is cured, inspect the ball with high definition video checking that no significant cracks have developed;
  - [ ] attempt crush th ball between thumb and forefinger (thumb at bottom);
  - [ ] if ball resists, then clay mix ready for lab test;
  - [ ] if ball crushes then clay content is too low or silt content to high, adjust and repeat test.

## Clay classification types

  1. 1-5% clay = sand (single grains stick to fingers)
  2. 5-20% clay = loamy-sand & sand-loam (5mm-25mm ribbon)
  3. 10-25% clay = fine sandy loam, loam, silty loam (15-25mm ribbon)
  4. 20-35% clay = sandy clay loam, fine sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay loam (20-55mm ribbon)
  5. 35-55% clay = sandy clay, light clay, silty clay (35-50 ribbon)
  6. 40-+55% clay = medium clay, heavy clay (+75mm ribbon)

# Flexural tensile strength test
 - [ ] flexure tensile strength aka modulus of rupture = average of 10-50% of compressive strength, e.g. stabalised adobe should have 30% or 3.5x flexural tensile strength.  Laboratory tests should be utilsed if on-site testing is inconslusive.
