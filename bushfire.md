Standards Australia Committee AS3959: Construction of buildings in bushfire prone areas.

Presenter: Colin Wood - Shoalhaven City Council Building Surveyor

Notes from webinar:

    AS3959 is the fourth edition (since 1999) of the Australian Standard for determining how prone your building is to the attack of a bushfire.  Each building in Australian is required to have a BAL (Bushfire Attack Level) rating prior to determining the building materials required for protection.

    Australia is the most fire prone continent in the world.  Significant revisions to the standard have resulted from fires which have taken place in: Canberra 2003, Victoria 2009, Blue Mountains Sydney 2013, Victoria/NSW in 2020.
    Applying a BAL rating using AS3959 to your building depends on several factors:

    Vegetarian proximity and type to building = Eucalyptus trees are filled with oil and have evolved to spread fire via ember attacks.  With over 1200 species of gum trees the ember/heat attack will vary based on the amount of fuel present in the vegetation.
    BAL ratings are usually assigned when a building is first built.  However, additional structures are often added to a building after it has been built: verandahs, porches, decks, pergolas, roof extensions, car ports, garages, etc. Each of these structures represent additional fuel which can increase your fire risk from *build-to-building” fires.
    The slope of land leading to the building, e.g. fire travels much faster up a slope, as fuel is positioned to ignite above the encroaching fire.  The greater the uphill slope leading to the building (+5 degrees) the easier for fire to spread *quickly).  See “Kinglake Black Saturday Fire Tornado” case study via the interwebs.
    Gaps in the joints between external walls / windows / doors / roofs present opportunities for embers to lodge into the buildings openings and ignite.

    Case study: Conjola Park NSW, 2150km south of Sydney, Population 400ppl in winter / 15k people in winter.  Lots of holiday homes.

    2020 fires burned in Conjola Park for 74 days.

    372 homes destroyed + 73 damaged.

     Many homes were built in the 1970s, containing asbestos hence pink/blue burn scars left from destroyed buildings.

    There were numerous ‘building to building’ fires, e.g. 1 home which ignited from an ember attack from vegetation, resulting in the creation of additional fires spreading via windows exploding from within to neighboring buildings.
    Water supply system failed during the fire because electricity was cut, and most water was pumped from city utility to property.  Most buildings who had their own water tank + power on their property survived the fire.
    Glass, doors and roofs were the vulnerable points for fires igniting the buildings.
    30 minutes was the average amount of time between the fire warning notification and the fire arriving at the building.

    Embers were the first thing noticed, followed by landscaping around home being the first to ignite.

    All landscaping vegetation should be several meters away from the building (to be included in forthcoming standard).  Grass around home can ignite the building.
    Landscaping logs (raised beds) for terraces are highly flammable.

    Debris on roofs and in gutters ignited first. = spend the extra money on gutter guards.
    Fire shutters proved an effective protection of stopping ignition of buildings via windows and doors.
    Propane (BBQ gas) bottles explode in a fire, and should be separated from the main house within their own structure.
    Vehicles in garages/carports act as a whole home firestarter.
    What worked?

    Subfloor insulations act as a whole home firestarter.
    Fire rated walls work, e.g. concrete/brick.
    Colorbond (galvanized metal) fences halted fire by protecting against radiant heat ignition.

    How did AS3959 stack up against the recent bushfires?

    Sub floor spaces caused fatalities.  Storing things under your house, below the floor without external protection of that storage area is a major risk for ignition via an ember attack.
    Fire risk vulnerability: windows (frame material, hardware, glazing, seals, weather strips, screens)
    Fire risk vulnerability: Doors (panel material, frame material, hawardware, glazing, seals, weather strips, screen doors)

    Doors *require* ‘draught excluders’ to stop embers from blowing into houses under door jams.

    Concession: carport and awnings (open on 3 sides, and NOT part of main roof) can now have translucent / transparent roof coverings if the building is in a low bushfire area, aka BAL12.5-BAL19.
    Bushfire resistant free species: Ash, silvertop, Blackbutt, Red River Gum, Red Ironbark, Kwila (Merbau), Turpentine.  See appendix F1 “Normative” in AS3959.
    New standard will come into effect on 1st of May 2022 via the NCC/BCA.

    Further work to do on the AS3959 Bushfire standard based on above lessons:

    New maintenance guideline being created for AS3959 to help guide building owners for how to upkeep property to resist bushfires.

    Subfloor storage and maintenance requirements being reviewed.

    Additional reviews on AS5414 (Bushfire water spray system)?

    Remote deployment of wall/roof drenchers to spray home with water.
    Requires 100k litre tank

    BAL-FlameZones roofs (and condensation ventilation) being reviewed.
    Non combustible sarking products now available.
    Building-to-building fires and use of fencing for protection.

    Heat emitting from within a house via the window and igniting a neighboring building (windows fail at 12Kw).  Heat emitted:

    2m = 52Kw-70Kw
    4m = 15Kw
    6m = 5Kw-8Kw

    Should neighboring windows be staggered?
    Should galvanized metal fences and/or fire shutters be required for buildings being built in BAL-FireZones?
    Should landscaping around homes be regulated with maintenance schedules?
    Should all garages be non-combustible with ember protection and pathway perimeters?
    How can building owners be made aware of maintenance to assure the standard?  Development of a new “BAL Rating Compliance Table”?
    Housing developers being required to build “Asset Protection Zone” in neighborhoods (APZ), e.g. parks, playgrounds, waterways, etc.
