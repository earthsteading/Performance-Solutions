    3. Referenced documents

The National Construction Code applicable to the proposed building is the BCA 2019 Amendment 1, including the provisions of Clause A2.2(4).



    4. The Act and regulations

The applicable legislation for this project is the Building Act 1993 (‘Act’)[^1] and Building Regulations 2018 (‘regulations’)[^2]. The regulations require building work to be designed in accordance with BCA.



    5. The Building Code of Australia

The BCA is a performance-based building code which provides a set of Performance Requirements with which to be complied. These Performance Requirements can either be met by a building design that satisfies a prescriptive or deemed-to-satisfy provisions, or the performance requirements of the BCA.

Part A2 of the BCA outlines that compliance with the BCA is achieved by complying with the governing requirements of the BCA and the Performance Requirements.

Performance Requirements are satisfied by one of the following:



1. A Performance Solution.
2. A Deemed-to-Satisfy solution.
3. A combination of the above.

A Performance Solution must be analysed and verified according to one or more assessment methods:



1. Evidence of Suitability in accordance with Part 5 that shows that the use of a material, product, plumbing and drainage product, form of construction or design meets the relevant Performance Requirements.
2. A Verification Method including:
    1. The verification methods provided in the BCA.
    2. Other verification methods acceptable by the appropriate authority that shows compliance with the relevant Performance Requirements.
4. Expert Judgement.
5. Comparison with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions

Part A5 of the BCA describes requirements in relation to the documentation of design and construction for various components of a building.





    6. ABCB Guidance Document

The ABCB (Australian Building Codes Board) in its guideline provides guidance for the design, documentation, assessment and approval of performance-based design solutions. The guideline is known as the ABCB Guidance Document – Performance Solution Process[^3] (‘ABCB Guide’). 

The ABCB Guide describes and outlines the process for the design and documentation of performance-based design solutions, including a process and pathway to agree to the parameters and outcomes of the design with stakeholders, to produce an acceptable design solution and the desired outcome for the building.

This PBDB has been prepared based on the ABCB Guide, and, where appropriate, this PBDB refers to other guides and standards bodies identified by the NCC as recognised standards bodies.

The ABCB Guide outlines the following steps for the adoption of a performance-based design solution whereby all four steps have been completed as follows.



1. Step 1: prepare a Performance Based Design Brief (PBDB) 
2. Step 2 carry out analysis, modelling and/or testing
3. Step 3: collate and evaluate results
4. Step 4: prepare a performance based design report (PBDR) for review by the RBS

The ABCB Guide recommends that design solutions require specific analytical analysis, modelling or testing relevant to its complexity, be evaluated according to one or more of the assessment methods as outlined in the BCA and that the preparation of the PBDB and the PBDR be carried out by appropriately qualified design practitioners.

    12. **Trial design used for evaluation**

The following technique has been adopted in the trial design for evaluation of the proposed solution, which meets the acceptance criteria outlined above.

The structural integrity of the external load-bearing wall system is defined by Australian Standard HB-195 Australian Earth Building Handbook and further defined by NZ Standard NZ4297 Engineering Design of Earth Buildings.  This includes requirements for structural robustness and rigidity as defined by ABCB Handbook of Structural Reliability Verification Methods and Handbook on Structural Robustness.  

Based on the above, the risk of failure in structural reliability and robustness is low, on the basis that the walls are constructed using AS-HB195, NZ4297 and via the Structural Calculations provided by the engineer. If follows that the rammed-earth wall constructed according to the above standards will comply with the Building Code of Australia.

The principal concern regarding structural integrity arises from the assembly of the component parts of the wall, or quality assurance of uniform construction thereby resulting in the wall settling at different rates of compression.

The provision of quantity surveying on-site during the wall construction in accordance with AS2159 and HB195 will provide sufficient assurance for a retaining wall to withstand the forces from the berm loading capacity.

The above measures will provide an acceptable outcome where the likelihood of structure failure is significantly reduced, to a level that will not be detrimental to the occupants nor neighboring properties.

    13. **Solution analysis and assessment**

 \
The proposed design solution for the proposed building is described as “to permit the use of retaining wall structures” as verified by way of an expert judgement in accordance with A2.2 of the BCA, Volume One Amendment 1.

The key acceptance criteria of the Performance Requirement are that the design of the building will safeguard the occupants from injury caused by structural failure; and safeguard people from loss of amenity caused by structural behaviour; and protect other property from physical damage caused by structural failure; and safeguard people from injury that may be caused by failure of,or impact with, glazing.

Based on the above and based on the relevant analysis, it is considered that the proposed design, and where appropriate to the degree necessary, will achieve compliance with the Performance Requirements of the BCA.



    14. **Recommendations for #PDS1**

    16. **Trial design used for evaluation**

The following technique has been adopted in the trial design for evaluation of the proposed solution, which meets the acceptance criteria outlined above.

AS 3700 – 2018 Masonry Structures[^4] includes a provision for design for water penetration. This includes requirements for cavities, weepholes, damp-proof-courses and flashings for cavity walls; and weather-resistant coating to single-leaf and solid walls.

It follows that the masonry wall will be adequately protected from water ingress if constructed in accordance with AS3700, preventing water penetration that could cause;



* unhealthy or dangerous conditions, or loss of amenity for occupants; and
* undue dampness or deterioration of building elements.

Based on the above, the risk of failure in weatherproofing of masonry walls is low, on the basis that the walls were constructed using Australian Standard Handbook 195 and NZ 4297 Engineering Design of Earth Buildings.

The principal concern regarding weatherproofing of masonry arises from drainage failure within the cavity, or failure of weather-resistant coating of single leaf walls and rising damp.

The provision of weepholes, flashings and damp-proof-courses in accordance with AS3700 will provide sufficient cavity drainage and a barrier to prevent moisture rising through the masonry from surface water that may be present at the base of the masonry wall.

The site location and weather patterns for the area also require consideration for significant rainfall requiring standard drainage in and around the footings and retaining wall.  Accordingly, the design highlights AS4678 Earth-retaining structures to assure the design of the subsoil and subsurface drainage is utilised for the southern berm wall of the building.

The above measures will provide an acceptable outcome where the likelihood of water penetration is significantly reduced, to a level that will not be detrimental to the occupants.

    17. **Solution analysis and assessment**

The proposed design solution for the proposed building is described as: “ to permit the use of masonry wall cladding systems as verified by way of an expert judgement in accordance with A2.2 of the BCA 2019, Volume One Amendment 1.”

The key criteria of the Performance Requirement are that the design of the building will safeguard the occupants from illness or injury and protect the building from damage caused by the weather and external moisture entering the building.

The acceptance criteria considered established to meet the Performance Requirements are that the external wall system must prevent the penetration of water that could cause unhealthy and dangerous conditions, or loss of amenity for occupants; and undue dampness or deterioration of building elements.

The Guide to the BCA establishes that a building is to be constructed to provide resistance to moisture penetrating from the outside including rising from the ground. A building must resist:

            



        * rainwater, coming through the roof or walls, due to poor waterproofing or flashing;
        * surface water, coming through the openings which are too low; and
        * ground water, which could rise up through porous floors or walls 

The roofs and walls (including windows, doors and other openings in the walls) must prevent water penetration which could cause dangerous conditions, loss of amenity or dampness and deterioration of building elements (see PDS3 for bottle-wall construction weatherproofing methodology).

Based on the above and based on the relevant analysis, it is considered that the proposed design, and where appropriate to the degree necessary, will achieve compliance with the Performance Requirements of the BCA.



    18. **Recommendation for PDS2**

Based on the above analysis and a compliance approach through expert evidence and comparison with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, it has been established that the design will meet the Performance Requirements of the BCA.

The following table outlines the requirements associated with the above performance design solution:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><p style="text-align: right">
<strong>Performance requirements for construction compliance and inspection:</strong></p>

   </td>
   <td>

<li>Built in compliance with AS3700 Masonry structures, AS HB195 Australian Earthbuilding handbook, NZS 4297 Engineering design of earth buildings and AS4678 Earth retaining structures (appendix G Drainage)

<li>Damp-proof course and a minimum slab height of 150mm above finished ground level.

<li>Depth of footing systems in accordance with the engineers design against the geotechnical site classification of “M” (Moderately reactive clay/silt which can experience moderate movement from moisture change), as per NCCv2 Part 3.2.5

<li>Cantilevered wall with standard angle of repose.

<li>Subsoil drainage system (and/or cantilevered wall drainage) for reinforced soil walls as per AS4678 and the Engineer’s specifications.

<li>Essential safety measure provisions for maintenance of earth buildings, including control joints, damp-proof flashing, door/window frames, drainage, earth floors, footings, metallic fixtures, roof, verandahs, eaves, surface coatings, termite monitoring, vegetative roots next to building and wall settlement including cracking, shrinkage and erosion.

    20. **Trial design used for evaluation**

The following technique has been adopted in the trial design and for evaluation of the proposed design solution to meeting the acceptance criteria outlined above.

The non-loadbearing composite masonry timber framed wall will be built according to AS4678. While concrete is a porous material, water permeability of concrete can be controlled through the curing process.. This includes a low water-to-cement ratio, adequate compaction and hydration. Additives such as silica or lime, water-reducing admixtures, plasticisers and waterproofing agents may be introduced to further reduce the formation of cracks and permeability of masonry.

Outside of the casting process, surface treatments may also be applied to improve the watertightness of the pre-cast concrete elements. Such treatments include: cement based render, resin-based render, vapour barriers, impregnation sealants, epoxies, polyurethane point and lime based renders.

Based on the above, the risk of failure in weatherproofing of timber framed composite masonry panels is low.  The principal concern regarding water penetration are the joints, including number, size, location, building elements abutment and shearing forces caused by building movement. 

Joint types which provide adequate weatherproofing include simple face-sealed joints where both sides of the joints are sealed with a weather-resistant sealant.  Open-drained joints also provide an equivalent degree of weatherproofing, with a similar sealant as face-sealed joint to the internal face and a baffle to the external face. Surface water that enters the joints are then channelled to the bottom of the panels and drained to the outside of the building.

As the joints are constructed on-site, there is a greater risk of failure due to incorrect installation, incorrect use of specified products or inadequate tolerances between panels. It is recommended that the joints are designed and constructed with an additional layer of redundancy (e.g., combination of joint types, additional waterproofing on inside face of wall) and/or inspection of joints during the construction process.

The above measures will provide an acceptable outcome where the likelihood of water penetration is significantly reduced, to a level that will not be detrimental to the occupants.  Testing of the wall system can be achieved via an in situ “water spray” test (based on AS4284) as outlined below.

    21. **Solution analysis and assessment**

 \
The key criteria of the Performance Requirement are that the design of the building will safeguard the occupants from illness or injury and protect the building from damage caused by the weather and external moisture entering the building.

The acceptance criteria considered established to meet the Performance Requirements are that the external wall system must prevent the penetration of water that could cause unhealthy and dangerous conditions, or loss of amenity for occupants; and undue dampness or deterioration of building elements.

The analysis will qualitatively determine a reusable methodology adopted for the construction of non-loadbearing composite masonry with inlaid glass bottle wall system, including the timber framed wall panels and the construction joints which prevent water and moisture from entering the building.

The proposed construction methodology will be assessed against the accepted methods of installation as advised by expert industry stakeholders based on AS4284 water penetration testing as adapted for residential single storey buildings. 

The walls (including windows, doors and other openings) must prevent water penetration which could cause dangerous conditions, loss of amenity or dampness and deterioration of building elements.  A report stating an adapted water penetration test will be provided by the builder and designer as per reference to AS4284 and NCCv2 V2.2.1 Weatherproofing.

Based on the above and based on the relevant analysis, it is considered that the proposed design, and where appropriate to the degree necessary, will achieve compliance with the Performance Requirements of the BCA.



    22. **Recommendations for #PDS3**

Based on the above analysis and a compliance approach through expert evidence and comparison with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, it has been established that the design will meet the Performance Requirements of the BCA.

The following table outlines the requirements associated with the above performance design solution:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><p style="text-align: right">
<strong>Requirements for construction compliance and inspection:</strong></p>

   </td>
   <td>
<ol>

<li>Composite masonry wall built using AS4678 and AS-HB195

<li>Water penetration test to be validated by a certified builder who has expertise in the construction of this wall type.

<li>The weather resistance of the composite masonry inlaid bottle-brick wall system is to be verified to the satisfaction of the Relevant Building Surveyor, by way of a test in accordance with AS4284:2008 - Testing of Building Façade.

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Why Open Source</span>_?

Open Source Innovation originated in the USA’s automobile and computer sectors (Ford and IBM), which provided economic advantages by accelerating sector wide innovation via open patent transactions.  The economic advantages of building cars and computers with fewer transactional costs is defined by 1991 Noble Prize winner in economics Ronald Coase.  By comparison the building industry continues to use standards which predate modern economics and is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

### Appendix 4: Letter from Owner-Builders

To Whom It May Concern

Katherine Procter and I, Jason Napiorkowski, have developed our skills in the construction of decorative bottle walls across several years in numerous locations. The information covered below includes details of Kate and my hands-on experience in building decorative bottle walls. We are confident and capable of the complete process of construction. We are also capable of repairs in the unlikely event of glass breaking during the use of the home.

In 2018 Kate and I spent two months in Taos, New Mexico, developing the skill sets with those who have pioneered the development of houses with designs similar to the proposed house at 229 Dingley Dell road. Taking part in their academy we constructed multiple decorative glass walls and were involved from start to finish. During our time in Taos, we also toured homes constructed as early as 1980 that had decorative bottle walls that remained issue free.

More recently, at a similar building in 2019 in East Augusta, Kate Procter led the design and construction of the decorative glass wall pictured to the right. The building has similar latitude and climate, although East Augusta has an average annual rainfall of 1130mm, whilst Mollongghip has 699mm. Despite the high levels of rainfall the wall has had no structural or moisture issues in the 3 years since construction was complete. Kate was intimately involved with all aspects from design, mixing cement, constructing the wall, and applying renders on both sides. She also helped train participants in a workshop at the time. I assisted, whilst also working elsewhere on the site. 

In 2022, Kate and I visited a building in South Australia with an almost identical floor plan to the proposed building at 229 Dingley Dell. Like the proposed building the SA building has decorative bottle walls on the North Eastern, and North Western sections of the building each with one side exposed on the outside of the building. Again, no issues have arisen with structure or moisture with either wall.

There are copious examples of the decorative glass bottle walls being built and maintained across the globe. We have no hesitation in employing the technique in our proposed build at 229 Dingley Dell.

If you wish to discuss the construction of the decorative glass bottle walls further, please feel free to contact us on the details below.

Thank You

Kate Procter and Jason Napiorkowski (Owner-Builders)
