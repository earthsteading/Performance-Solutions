The analysis and/or assessment carried out in the Performance Based Design Solutions Brief (PBDB) describes: (a) the proposed performance-based design solution for the building, (b) identifies key performance criteria, (c) acceptance criteria, (d) compliance approach, (e) analysis and/or assessment, and (f) any conditions associated with the design solutions to achieve compliance with the Performance Requirement of the Building Code of Australia (NCC 2019)

This report contains the outcomes of the relevant analytical assessment, design calculations and verification considered necessary to demonstrate that the performance-based design solution and/or non-compliances comply with the relevant Performance Requirements of the NCC.

The proposed performance-based design solution included in this Performance Based Design Solutions Report has been subject to confirmation of all stakeholder agreement to the analysis, design approach and conditions as demonstrated by the attached Regulation 126 Certificate of Conformance.

The outcomes and conclusions of the analysis and assessment carried out in the Performance Based Design Brief (PBDB) have been documented in this Performance Based Design Report (PBDR) in accordance with Australian Building Codes Board’s guidance documents on the performance solution process. 


## Scope and Objectives

The aim of this report is to document the outcomes, conclusion, recommendations and conditions of the analysis and assessment carried out via the Performance Based Design Brief (PBDB), which was reviewed by the stakeholders on the 15th of August 2022.

The performance-based design solutions considered in the PBDB were agreed by the design team in response to the request by the Relevant Building Surveyor (RBS) that the original proposed design did not meet the Deemed-to-Satisfy (‘DtS’) Provisions of the Building Code of Australia 2019 (NCC 2019).

The proposed design solutions outlined below have been analysed against the evidence, and demonstrates the proposed design solutions will satisfy the relevant Performance Requirements of the National Construction Code 2019.

This report only addresses the performance-based design solutions identified by the design team and/or the RBS; with all other aspects of the proposed building designed and approved as complying with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions of the NCC 2019.

The outcomes and conclusion of this PBDR are based on the information reasonably available at the date of the issue of this report and shall be applicable only to the circumstances envisaged and outlined herein.

The outcomes and conclusion of this PBDR have been subject to confirmation by all relevant stakeholders who are in  agreement on the analysis, design approach and resulting conditions.



    1. The Act and regulations

The applicable legislation for this project is the Building Act 1993 (‘Act’) and Building Regulations 2018 (‘regulations’). The regulations require building work to be designed in accordance with NCC.



    2. The National Construction Code

The NCC is a performance-based building code which provides a set of Performance Requirements with which to comply. These Performance Requirements can either be met by a building design that satisfies a prescriptive or Deemed-to-Satisfy provisions, or the performance requirements of the NCC.

Part A2 of the NCC outlines that compliance with the NCC is achieved by complying with the governing requirements of the BCA and the Performance Requirements.

Performance Requirements are satisfied by one of the following: (1) a performance solution, (2) a Deemed-to-Satisfy solution; or (3) a combination of the above.

A Performance Solution must be analysed and verified according to one or more assessment methods:



1. Evidence of Suitability in accordance with Part 5 that shows that the use of a material, product, plumbing and drainage product, form of construction or design meets the relevant Performance Requirements.
2. A Verification Method including:
    1. The verification methods provided in the BCA.
    2. Other verification methods acceptable by the appropriate authority that shows compliance with the relevant Performance Requirements.
3. Expert Judgement.
4. Comparison with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions

Part A5 of the BCA describes requirements in relation to the documentation of design and construction for various components of a building.



    3. ABCB Guidance Document

The ABCB in its guideline provides guidance for the design, documentation, assessment and approval of performance-based design solutions. The guideline is known as the ABCB Guidance Document – Performance Solution Process[^1] (‘ABCB Guide’). 

The ABCB Guide describes and outlines the process for the design and documentation of performance-based design solutions, including a process and pathway to agree to the parameters and outcomes of the design with stakeholders, to produce an acceptable design solution and the desired outcome for the building.

This PBDR has been prepared based on the ABCB Guide, and, where appropriate, this PBDB refers to other guides, such as the International Fire Engineering Guidelines (‘IFEG’)[^2] and the Australian Fire Engineering Guidelines (‘AFEG’)[^3] where the design relates to fire engineering design solutions.

The ABCB Guide outlines the following steps for the adoption of performance-based design solution: (1) prepare a Performance Based Design Brief (PBDB), (2) carry out analysis, modelling and/or testing, (3) collate and evaluate results, and (4) prepare a performance based design report.

The ABCB Guide recommends that design solutions require specific analytical analysis, modelling or testing relevant to its complexity, be evaluated according to one or more of the assessment methods as outlined in the BCA and that the preparation of the PBDB and the PBDR be carried out by appropriately qualified design practitioners.



1. Stakeholder Engagement

    12. Outcomes of the Analysis and Assessment

The following summarises the outcomes, conclusion, recommendations and conditions of the analysis and assessment carried out of the proposed performance-based design included in the PBDB.

The proposed design solution for the proposed building is described as: 

The external wall/roof system must meet the weatherproofing requirements as outlined in P2.6.1 in the NCC 2019.

The Performance Requirements of the BCA requires that the proposed design solution meets the criteria of P2.6.1..


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>P2.6.1. Acceptance Criteria:</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Compliance:</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Analysis:</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>A building must have, to the degree necessary, a level of thermal performance to facilitate the efficient use of energy for artificial heating and cooling.
   </td>
   <td>Addressed
   </td>
   <td>The hempcrete insulation with a recognised R-value of 4.0 (200mm) and a U-value  of 0.17 W/m2k, meet and exceeds the deemed-to-satisfy requirements for modelling the building’s thermal performance.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Based on the above and based on the relevant analytical analysis and assessment it is considered that the proposed design, and where appropriate to the degree necessary, will achieve compliance with the Performance Requirements of the NCC.

The analytical assessment method carried out for proposed performance-based design solutions and/or non-compliance with the NCC considers the following to evaluate the design proposal: (a) comparative analysis, (b) qualitative analysis, (c) deterministic analysis:

The report content is limited to the appropriate considerations as outlined in the NCC. Acts of malicious intent, arson or terrorism are outside the scope of this assessment. 

All essential equipment services and strategies will be maintained to the operational capacity to which they were designed, installed, commissioned and certified.

All installations will be commissioned and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 

All other components of the building not addressed within this document will be installed in accordance with the BCA requirements that were applicable when the design was prepared (either DTS or Performance Based) and / or remain as required within the existing building permit condition / design approach.

All codes and standards referred to are assumed to be the current version at the time of design and installation, or an alternative approved edition.  This also includes any buildings designed to international codes providing an equivalent or better level of safety or amenity and having been approved by the responsible authority. 

All calculations carry a degree of uncertainty and conditions may transpire that are outside what has been anticipated in this report.  Any entity relying on this document acknowledges this risk.
