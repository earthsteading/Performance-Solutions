# Earth floors (block and rammed)

## Earthen floor requirements:
  - [ ] Support imposed loads: earth floors should be founded on firm well-drained soils as per AS2870
  - [ ] Resist wear from general use: stabilisation with cement or lime improves both strength and durability.
  - [ ] Resist the effects of insect attack
  - [ ] Provide adequate slip resistance
  - [ ] Have thermal mass and insulation: sub-floor insulation may be required to provide sufficient thermal protection
  - [ ] Easy to maintain: clear maitenance guidance should be provided
  - [ ] Prevent moisture ingress: the wearing surface of the slab should be a minimum of 150 mm above finished ground level; in areas of very high rainfall this should be raised to at least 300 mm

## Construction:
  - [ ] Excavate down to the firm subsoil layer, on top of which a 100mm thick layer of compact sand is placed, in accordance with AS 2870
  - [ ] Alternatively, a layer of hardcore may be compacted onto weaker subsoil layers before placement of the sand.
  - [ ] The substrate layer must be firmly compacted before placing the damp-proofing membrane. The membrane is essential to prevent ingress of moisture from capillary rise.
  - [ ] Rammed earth and poured-earth floors are compacted directly on top of the membrane, which should be able to withstand compaction without damage. 
  - [ ] A 25mm thick layer of bedding sand is placed onto the membrane before placing mud brick or stabilised pressed block floors.
  - [ ] Floors are structurally independent of the walls, to limit the likelihood of cracking from shrinkage, foundation movement, applied loads, and other actions. Walls are supported on strip-footings.
  - [ ] Control joints are required to alleviate cracking from shrinkage.  If earth floor is placed atop concrete slab then control joints should coincide.
  - [ ] Once shrinkage is complete, joints can be filled. Curing floors should be protected from rapid dry-out.

## Maitenance: 
  - [ ] Moisture and wear resistance is improved by using a variety of different sealants and oils; similar to those used to protect walls. 
  - [ ] Linseed oil, wax and proprietary chemical sealants are the most commonly used for maitenance. Many of these will change the colour of the floor. 
  - [ ] As an alternative wearing surface, 25mm thick soil:cement finish may be used. 
  - [ ] If the floor is to be washed or risks being wetted, appropriate measures, such as providing an upstand, are required to ensure that the moisture does not enter the walls as well. 
  - [ ] In areas prone to repeated wetting, such as bathrooms and laundries, alternative flooring solutions may be more appropriate.
