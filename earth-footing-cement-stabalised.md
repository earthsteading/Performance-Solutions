## Architectural drawing instructions
 - [ ] These drawing must be verified in conjunction with the architectural drawings and the engineered footing calculations report.
 - [ ] Refer to architectural drawings for all setting out dimensions. 
 - [ ] Any discrepancies between the engineering and architectural drawings to be resolved prior to construction. 
 - [ ] Maintain footing depth at all setdowns.
 - [ ] Structural drawings must not be scaled. 
 - [ ] If depth of uncompacted fill beneath slab exceeds 300mm, slab depth increased to 120mm and use SL72 rebar top and bottom. 
 - [ ] All footings continually trenched minimum 200mm into firm natural ground. 
 - [ ] If trenched piers are to be used in lieu of continuous trenching (minimum 200mm into firm natural ground), they are to be 1000mm long x footing width wide and trenched 200mm into firm natural ground. 
 - [ ] Piers are to be provided at each footing beam intersection and at corners, with 2.5m maximum centers thereafter. 
 - [ ] Increase ligature spacing between piers to 300mm centers max. 
 - [ ] Use SL92 top (or SL72 top & bottom) in lieu of specified slab mesh where brittle floor coverings such as tiles or slates are to be used, except where slab is left to cure for 3 months and a flexible adhesive is used. 
 - [ ] Laps in mesh to be one full square plus 25mm. 
 - [ ] Set down all strip footings as required. 
 - [ ] Footing at boundary must be founded minimum 600mm below adjacent existing ground level. 
 - [ ] Foundations adjacent to services, excavations or batter, etc. shall be extended down such that the influence line of the foundation is below the adjacent service.

## Construction process:
 - [ ] All materials should be stabilised, using cement, and compacted to their maximum dry density at their optimum moisture content. Unstabilised materials, including mud bricks, are generally unsuitable. 
 - [ ] Stabilised earth footings should be founded only on firm stable soils and, due to the significant reduction in strength in the presence of water, on dry and well-drained sites. Prevention of moisture build-up by regular maintenance is, therefore, particularly important. 
 - [ ] The difficulties of providing reinforcement ensures that earth footings are only used in regions of low seismicity and in non-cyclonic areas. 
 - [ ] Only used on Class A foundations (in accordance with AS 2870)
 - [ ] Site must be predominantly dry and well drained. Some limited increase in moisture is allowed, but only during peak rainfall events, and site must have no risk of flooding
 - [ ] Site must be located in a region of low seismicity
 - [ ] Building length to not exceed 25m
 - [ ] Walls not greater than 3m in height
 - [ ] No garden beds to be placed within 2 m of the completed building
 - [ ] No trees or shrubs to be within a distance of the footing equal to 1 % their mature height
 - [ ] Site drainage and all plumbing services to be maintained in accordance with AS2870
 - [ ] The minimum suggested footing depth is 400 mm. 
 - [ ] Footing widths should be varied to suit wall thickness, but a minimum footing width of 300 mm is also recommended.
 - [ ] Before placing a damp-proofing membrane, the base of the excavation should be lined with a 20 mm to 50 mm thick blinding layer of clean quarry sand or weak concrete. 
 - [ ] High impact resistant polyethylene damp-proofing membrane can be used to line the footing; however, particular care should be exercised during compaction to avoid puncturing the membrane. Where possible, any punctures or tears must be repaired and properly sealed with like material.
 - [ ] Chemical damp-proofing measures are commonly used in rammed earth construction as an alternative to membrane protection. The fresh mix of cement-stabilised soil should be compacted sufficiently to obtain at least 98% of the Proctor maximum dry density. 
 - [ ] As with wall construction, compaction may be undertaken either manually or mechanically. 
 - [ ] Material should be compacted in loose layers 50 mm to 100 mm thick. 
 - [ ] Each layer is compacted in turn between permanent or temporary supports until the footing is complete. 
 - [ ] After compaction, the material should be allowed to cure undisturbed for at least 7 days. 
 - [ ] Footings should be covered with plastic sheeting, damp hessian sacks or sprayed with water, to ensure proper hydration of the cement during this period.

## Materials:
 - [ ] Soils suitable for pressed block and rammed earth wall construction are also suitable for stabilised earth footings. 
 - [ ] Because footings are fully supported, at least until the cement has hardened, lower clay content soils are also encouraged. 
 - [ ] Typically Class A type soils are ideal. 
 - [ ] After excavation, soils should be treated in the same manner as soils for wall construction. 
 - [ ] All root material should be removed. 
 - [ ] Soil should be stabilised using 5% to 12% cement by mass. 
 - [ ] A cement content sufficient to attain unconfined wet characteristic compressive strength of not less than 2.5 MPa is recommended. 
 - [ ] Ingredients should be thoroughly dry mixed before adding sufficient water to attain the optimum moisture content. 
 - [ ] Once adequately wet mixed, material should be compacted in place within 30 minutes to 45 minutes. 
 - [ ] Unused material should be discarded.
