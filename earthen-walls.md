# Earthen material inspector checklists
For each of the below earthen construction componets, a performance solution should be agreed between your builder, architect, engineer and building surveyor prior to applying for a build permit.

## Rammed earth (formwork + tyre encased)
In scope: 
 - [ ] formwork walls
 - [ ] brick and tyre encased, both for load-bearing and non-loadbearing internal and external walls.

Out of scope:
 - [ ] multi-storey unless via engineered Performance Solution
 - [ ] earthquake and fire safety (not yet tested)

Structural integrity robustness checks:
 - [ ] If using internally reinforced steel, then use of conduits (vs plastic) is recommeneed to avoid cracking during shrinkage and enables the vertical rod to be post-tensioned.
 - [ ] Rammed earth can be used without stabalisation however use of portland cement to provide structural durability is recommended for walls built using formwork vs earthen bricks.  Rammed earth walls should be tested on site prior to approval.
 - [ ] Moisutre content for rammed earth mix must be within a 3% band of the optimum moisture content, see testing methods above.
 - [ ] Acceptable compaction tests can be determined by a 6.5kg hammer being dropped 300mm onto a rammed earth layer of 100-150mm thickness and the resulting "rings" resisting indentation.
 - [ ] For rammed earthed pressed bricks, cement is often used as a stabaliser.  Compression of bricks should be via a hydraulic power compression ram or manual long lever arm to activate a rammed compression chamber.
 - [ ] Clay and other earthen materials used from on-site should be geotechnically tested.

Quality assembly assurance checks:
 - [ ] Mechanical ramming is recommended, however manual hand ramming is acceptable especially in hard to reach areas.
 - [ ] Cold joints should be rougheded to an amplitude of 5mm including clearing the old surface with water to restablish a new bond.  NB checmical keying compounds have also been used.
 - [ ] For cement stabalised rammed earth, all of the mixed batch shall be placed within 45 minutes of cement first coming in contact with the water or damp earth.
 - [ ] Holes in bricks to facilitate installation of service conduits should be drilled on site to meet in situ measurement requirements, ideally while the brick is "green" vs a cured dry brick. 
 - [ ] All holes (once conduit is installed) must be wetted and filled wiith mortar.
 - [ ] Bricks should be laid in accordance with AS3700.  In particular compression planes should be perpendicular to the face of the wall.
 - [ ] For bricks which intersect a wall in a "T" pattern, the abutting wall's bricks should extend 100mm into the load-bearing wall.
 - [ ] For bricks reinforcing steel grid or geogrid should be used in every third course with a maximum vertical spacing of 450mm for bond strength.
 - [ ] Cracks over 3mm in width which appear on both side of a panel are not acceptable.  See 'control joint' guidance above.
 - [ ] Surface finishes of earthen rammed walls should be considered by architect and engineer as part of the deisgn schematic, including: rough, smooth, pebble, flat, colour, etc.

## Adobe bricks and cob walls
In scope: freestanding load-bearing walls, non-loadbearing infill materials, furniture, etc.
 - [ ] Earth and straw for cob mixing (mechanical or rotary hoe) should be left for a 12 hour soak after initial mix, and remixed prior to placing. 
 - [ ] Brick size should be a minimum of 280mm nominal thckness for thermal and structural performance.  Brick size may and should vary to enable bonding around corners, curves and overlapping bond walls.
 - [ ] Sand or straw may be added to control drying thereby allowing the interior of the brick to dry at the same rate as the exterior which will help prevent cracking.  Straw and cellulose natural fibres should be cut to 1/2 the size of the brick/wall and added to the mix evenly.  Portland cement as an additive is also often used.
 - [ ] Adobe bricks should be molded either via a mold which is removed immediatley and air cured; or waiting until the mixture dries and brick shrinks sufficiently to remove mold.  Air drying is preferred over sun baking which will result in additional cracking.
 - [ ] Air dried above 5 degrees celsius for a minimum of 28 days in an exterior environment protected from strong wind and rain.
 - [ ] A curing process must be undertaken to assure water evaporation is limited for cracking during shrinkage.
 - [ ] After curing bricks should be laid on their side, scraped and tapped producing a 'clear ring'.
 - [ ] Cores for vertical reinforcement or service conduit may be drilled or moulded.  Holes shall be centerd in the brick and less than 1/3 the size of the brick.
 - [ ] There should be no more than 4 layers of brick laid per day to assure mortar thickness (>60mm) can stabalise per day.
 - [ ] Bricks should be laid in an overlapping bond pattern with a minimum overlap of 25%.  English, flemish, garden and stetcher bond patterns are allowed as per AS3700.
 - [ ] All brick surfaces shall be moistened before laying to reduce mortar shrinkage.
 - [ ] Good practice in slump and bellying tests should be utilised to assure mortar can fill the gaps between variation in brick sizes.  Mortar joints should be flush and no deeper than 5mm.  See above for control joint guidance.
 - [ ] For cob walls, deep keying between courses (40-50mm deep w/ 100mm centres) is required to assure bonding between layers.  Courses of 200-300mm can be laid as soon as cob is dry enough to support the weight of the next layer.  Reinforcement both vertical and horizontal should be inlaid as wall is built up.
 - [ ] Fittings, frames and vertical reinforcements shall be embedded into the wall.  Footings with vertical rebar should be allowed to settle.  Posts with fixing ties must be allowed to harden first.
 - [ ] Water pipes must be encased within conduit if going through an adobe wall.
 - [ ] Loadbearing walls should be finished smooth, not raked.
 - [ ] Control joints are recommended to assure cracking will not cause failure in earthen walls which are not cement/lime stabalised.
 - [ ] Low density adobe and cob (800-1400kg/m3 are to be coated with hydrated lime plaster.

## Poured earth and in-situ adobe (portland cement reinforced)
 - [ ] Sample test walls should be tested prior to building permit being issued, with confirmation of flexural tensile strength.
 - [ ] The below methods use 5-15% of portland cement in mixes to reduce shrinkage and enhance strength, without cement see boxed cob standards above. Hydrated/quick lime may also be used as a stabalisation additive for performance solutions.
 - [ ] Poured earth is moulded into formwork panels, and are poured as castellated patterns.
 - [ ] Earth formwork varies widely in dimensions and is provided by a variety of proprietary systems.
 - [ ] Wall panels should not exceed sizes (450mm high or 800mm long), unless tested.
 - [ ] In-situ adobe utilises stablised cement and is placed in brick layers allowing them to set and shrink prior to next layer being laid.  Bonding between courses is required.
 - [ ] Mixes require clay to enable molding (before cement hydration), while containing aggregate to prevent shrinking.
 - [ ] Surface cracks can be filled if there is no loss of structural integrity.
 - [ ] Soils should be soaked 12 hours before molding, with cement added just in time for mixing and placement.
 - [ ] Clay lumps +12mm should be exluded from mix.  Aggregate size should not exceed 25mm diameter.  Use of sieving or pulvarising is acceptable.  Sand and water can be used to assure mix is low moisture but still pliable.
 - [ ] Molds should be vibrated, rodded, tamped to assure no voids in mix.
 - [ ] Once poured, top of mold should be roughened to a minimum 5mm amplitude to key bond for subsequent courses.
 - [ ] Reinforcement between layers should be at 450mm centres for mesh reinforcement and 900mm centres for steel bar reinforcement.  Wet embedded geogrid between courses as per proprietary systems like SuperAdobe(TM).
 - [ ] Previous coursers should be wetted prior to adding a new course layer.
 - [ ] No more than 450mm courses should be laid per day to assure drying and curing process is initiated.
 - [ ] If slumping, deformation or damage is noticed then further curing is required to achieve structural rigidity.
 - [ ] Corners and abutting walls should be bonded into wall by a 100mm bond.
 - [ ] The wall should be moist cured by spraying with a concrete curing agent, or covered with plastic/fabric to retain moisture for 7 days prior to being allowed to dry.  Wall should be protected from sun/wind while curing.
 - [ ] Service conduit holes can be molded into formwork and/or drilled after curing.
 - [ ] Surface coatings are not required but are often utilised for maitenance, serviceability and aesthetics.
 - [ ] Examples of permeable wall coatings: earth+lime+gypsum, lime based paint, lime plasters, potasium silicate, boiled linseed oil, plaster with silicate mineral paint, etc.  Non-permeable coatings (>290ng/Pa.s.m2) can trap moisture in the wall resulting in structural cracking, e.g. cement stucco without lime should not be used.  Coastings which decrease earthen erosion by helping to maintain bond is the aim (+500 ng/Pa.s.m2).
 - [ ] Dust reducing coatings (internal walls): for wallpaper diluted casein-borax glue or cullulose glue, clay based paints, lime based whitewash, potasium silicate mineral paint, gypsum plasters, lime plasters and bagging / scrubbing walls with organic additives.
 - [ ] Internal earthen walls must be protected in wet areas (bathroom, laundry, kitchen, atriums, etc.) as per AS3740.
 - [ ] All internal earthen walls require good ventilation as earth walls are hygroscopic / breathable.

### Earthen mortar joints
 - [ ] Sand + lime + portland cement = 9:2:1 to 9:3:0 ratio; mechanically mixed, slump tested and laid in 10-20mm thick beds.
 - [ ] Sand and clay earthen mortars must be trial tested and quality controlled during production, pressing/ramming and laid in 15-35mm thick beds.
 - [ ] There should be no internal voids in mortar courses.

### External earthen surface coatings
 - [ ] cement+sand plaster mix ratio = 1:3
 - [ ] lime+cement+sand plaster mix ratios = 1:5:15 / 1:1:6
 - [ ] lime+sand plaster mix ratio = 1:3
 - [ ] lime plasters may include fibres such as straw, hemp, animal hair or fine polypropolene fibres. On-site testing required.
 - [ ] lime based plasters should not be applied in the direct sun and ideally with water mister to activate curing. Beware lime burns to eyes.
 - [ ] earthen clay plaster = local soil ratio, requires site test.
 - [ ] straw+clay plaster = local soil ratio, requires site test.
 - [ ] custom earthen plasters: ratios of clay+sand+fiberous mix must be tested and cured prior.  Earthen plasters will also bond to straw bale, concrete block, plywood, carpet and pasterboard.
 - [ ] organic additives = cellulose paper pulp, casein-borax glue, cooked flour paste are also added to earth plaster to increase hardness.  Application methods include sponge, plastic trowel and bagging
 - [ ] gypsum plasters should not be used on external surfaces.

### Earthen reinforcement
  - [ ] Extruded polypropolene mesh must have a minimum weight of 70g/m2 and a min tensile strength of 4.5kN/m in logitudal and transverse directions.
  - [ ] Fibreglass mesh shall be alkaline resistent with a minimum density of 60g/m2 for interior walls and 160g/m2 for exterior walls and minimum mesh size of 8mm.
  - [ ] Galvanised steel mesh should only be used in cement (low lime) mixes to avoid steel corrosion.  Chicken wire is commonly used for steel mesh reinforcing between layers (diameter 0.7-1.0mm aka 19-22 gauge with hexagonal gaps >25mm and 150mm lapped joints).  Chicken wired used for custom curves and angled surfaces.  
  - [ ] Staples should be placed diagonally across reinforcement mesh, e.g. exterior wall staples should be pneumatically drives with 1.29mm diamter (16 gauge) with 38mm legs and 11mm crown).
  - [ ] Steel mesh shall be seperated from preservative treated timber by a damp proof layer.

### Earthen construction maitenance
 - [ ] Surface coatings require maitenance for the lifetime of the building to prevent damage or degredation.
 - [ ] Management of earth wall permeance to maintain a stable hydroscopy ergo robustness is an annual activity.
 - [ ] Onsite humidity sensors should be utilsed throughout the life of the building.
